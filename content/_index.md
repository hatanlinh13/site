Hello friends!

My name is [Hà Tấn Linh](https://tlh.dev) (or [Tan-Linh Ha](https://tlh.dev) if you prefer that way). I'm currently working as a software engineer at [OPSWAT](https://www.opswat.com), my work focused on building new features for our [CDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Disarm_%26_Reconstruction) solution. Before that, I finished my honors program and received a bachelor's degree of Information Technology at [HCMUS](https://hcmus.edu.vn) in Vietnam.

Usually in my free time, I love to learn and do new things on my GNU/Linux-powered machine. My interested topics including system programming, networking and distributed systems; though I'm still a beginner in all of them.

Welcome to my little corner!
