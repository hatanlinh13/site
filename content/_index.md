Hello friends!

My name is [Hà Tấn Linh](https://tlh.dev) (or [Tan-Linh Ha](https://tlh.dev) if you prefer that way). I'm currently working as a software engineer at [OPSWAT](https://www.opswat.com). Before that, I finished my honors program and received a bachelor's degree of Information Technology at [HCMUS](https://hcmus.edu.vn) in Vietnam.

I've always had a big interest in low-level system programming and always dreamed that I will be able to contribute to the open source community in this particular area. But I never had a chance to start; or in other words, I was lazy :)

I know I must start somewhere. Therefore, I created this website to mark a starting point. I will try to write about my journey to system programming on this [blog](/blogs/); and hopefully, in a near future, I could have something proudly to share to the world via my [projects](/projects/).
